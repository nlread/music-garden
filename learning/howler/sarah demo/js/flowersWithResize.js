/*
Task list:
- limit how big you can make the flowers
- make it so flowers can't overlap the menu (limit resizing)
- make flowers inherit from component/make plant class


Future things to fix
- make flowers scale based on actual mouse distance, not just estimated constants
- look into let vs var
- classes(?) for menu, flowers on flower menu, flowers dropped
- once you have classes/items, you can add event handlers specifically to them (path.onDrag) instead of having a tool handle all of them, which might make code simpler (altho idk if we can apply it to a whole class of items, we might need an array of all the flowers on the screen or something like that)
