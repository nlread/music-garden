/*
Task list:
- make it so you can make flowers smaller! (this involved figuring out how to scale based on event.delta, not just my approximation)
- making it smaller is a lot more complicated - how do you decide when the user is trying to make it smaller vs. larger? it's probably based on whether they're moving towards or away from the image center, right? how do we figure that out?
- make it so you can't resize menu flowers!


Future things to fix
- limit how big you can make the flowers
- make it so flowers can't overlap the menu (limit resizing)
- look into let vs var
- classes(?) for menu, flowers on flower menu, flowers dropped
